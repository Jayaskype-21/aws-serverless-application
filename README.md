# Serverless Application Using AWS

Built a fully managed backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.  
This project was developed during my internship at Gtek Techno Solutions for Akshar Tech.

## ⚙️ AWS Services Used
- AWS Lambda – Serverless compute
- Amazon API Gateway – REST API management
- Amazon DynamoDB – NoSQL data storage
- Amazon S3 – Static content hosting

## 🧠 Key Learning
Event-driven design, scalability without server management, and cost optimization.
